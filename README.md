# ZLib Koka Bindings

This is a library that provides a generated api wrapper around the [zlib](https://zlib.net/) library.

Ideally we will provide a higher level api for common usages, so that you don't have to deal with the low level details of the zlib library or memory management.

Obviously some memory management will be required, but we will try to make it as easy as possible.

The license of the zlib library is [here](https://zlib.net/zlib_license.html), as well as appended in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file.

The bindings themselves are subject to the zlib license, as they are a derivative work of the zlib library.

However, the high level api is subject to the the Koka-Community standard [license](./LICENSE) which is [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
